# String generator 2.0

New and improved charecter generator which uses now gpu to generate charecter faster. Still a lot testing to do. Just a personal fun project.

1st run the venv using `./run` in terminal to start the venv.

Now install the requirements in venv by running this code.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Now you can generate any type of chararecter book.

Run this command to generate 4 digit number book.

`python main.py 1234 4 demo_book`

Here **main.py** is the file name. **1234** is the charecter type. **4** is how much column or how long do you want the charecters do you need and at last book name, you can give any name to your book.
